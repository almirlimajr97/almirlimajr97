## Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

### About me:

- My name is Almir and I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
- I am an economist by trade, having earned a bachelor's degree from Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC) in 2022.
- Since September 2019, I have worked at ItaÃº Unibanco, currently as a data scientist for its Credit Policy team.
- I am big into using data to help understand real-life problems. College and work got me hooked on data modelling, and now I am diving into Data Science.
- I am a huge fan of sports, especially baseball (big Mets and Palmeiras fan here!).
